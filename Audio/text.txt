Classes & Objects in Python – The Blueprint of Life! 

What’s a Class?
A class is like a blueprint or template used to create multiple objects. Think of it as a recipe like it defines what ingredients and steps (which are attributes and methods) are needed, but you can use it to create different dishes (objects)!

Imagine This:
You want to make thousands of cars. Instead of designing each car separately, you create a blueprint that defines the basic features of a car—like color, wheels, and model.

The Class Defines:
- Properties also called as Attributes – Things like color, wheels, and model.
- Actions also can be said as Methods – Things the car can do, like honking or driving.
 
What’s an Object?
An object is a real instance of a class. Think of it as an actual car created from the blueprint. 
Each car (object) follows the same structure but can have different properties.
For example, from our Car class, we can create:
A red sedan with 4 wheels.
A blue sports car with 4 wheels.
Even though they are different cars, they are both objects of the same class!
 
Now Let's Take an Example for classes and objects:

Key Takeaways:
->  A class is a blueprint that defines attributes & behaviors.
-> An object is an instance of a class.
-> Objects can have different values but follow the same structure.
-> Methods define what an object can do, like drive().
Fun Fact: Everything in Python such as numbers, strings, lists—is actually an object of some class!
